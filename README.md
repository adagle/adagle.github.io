If there is any issue running this running this or looking at the website, please feel free to delete the Read Me file. This was added after completion for context.

Problem 1:
This web adress adagle.github.io contains a personal website with a landing page describing myself generally.
There is also a link to a CV and Resume as well as a website link for the lab I am currently working in.
Some prominent details (research/publications/presentations) from my CV/Resume are summarized and I added an interests page for fun.

Problem 2:
Problem 2 is answered in the Homework & Examples tab under HW 4: Problem 2
There are some noteable issues formatting with the axis tick labels in R.
I suspect there is also an easier way for making the bar graph/histogram in the bottom right by using histogram bins for example rather than creating a factored variable by recoding all individual entries.
For the purposes of this assignment, recoding the entries got me what I wanted showing a left skewed distribution but for larger datsets I would look for a more efficient way to do this.
